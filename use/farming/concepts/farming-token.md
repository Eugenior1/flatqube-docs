# Farming token

In order to become farmers in a certain pool, you need to store a certain amount of **Farm tokens** in this pool - **Liquidity Provider** **(LP) tokens** of the corresponding [liquidity pool](../../pools/).

LP tokens represent a crypto liquidity provider’s share of a pool, and the crypto liquidity provider remains entirely in control of the token.\
For example, if you contribute $10 USD worth of assets to a liquidity pool that has a total worth of $100, you would receive 10% of that pool’s LP tokens. You receive 10% of the LP tokens because you own 10% of the crypto liquidity pool. The LP tokens become your claim to your share of the pool’s assets. Holding these LP tokens allows you total control over when you withdraw your share of the pool without interference from anyone — even the FlatQube platform.

In exchange for blocking liquidity in the form of LP tokens in the farming pool, the farmer receives a [reward](reward-token.md), depending on his **share** in this pool.
