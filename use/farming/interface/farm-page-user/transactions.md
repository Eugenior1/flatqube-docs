# Transactions

The bottom block of the Farming pool page is the **transaction block**.&#x20;

**The transaction block** displays all transactions associated with this Farming Pool. \
The types of these operations are divided into **Claim**, **Deposits**, **Withdraws** and **Reward deposits**.&#x20;

* ****[**Claims** ](../../how-to/claim-reward.md)- withdraw of Unclaimed reward to the DEX account balance.&#x20;
* ****[**Deposits** ](../../how-to/deposit-farm-tokens.md)- locking LP (faming) tokens in the pool.&#x20;
* ****[**Withdraws** ](../../how-to/withdraw-farm-tokens.md)- withdrawal of LP (farming) tokens from the pool.&#x20;
* ****[**Reward deposits**](../../concepts/reward-token.md) - adding reward tokens by the pool administrator to the reward balance.&#x20;

You can switch between filters for displaying transactions at the <mark style="color:green;">top of the block</mark>, as well as enable the <mark style="color:orange;">display mode</mark> of only those transactions that are linked in your DEX account.&#x20;
