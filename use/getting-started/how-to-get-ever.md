The third way is to buy WEVER [directly on FlatQube](https://flatqube.io/swap/0:a519f99bb5d6d51ef958ed24d337ad75a1c770885dcd42d51d6663f9fcdacfb2/0:a49cd4e158a9a15555e624759e2e4e766d22600b7800d891e46f9291f044a93d) and then [unwrap](https://docs.tonbridge.io/crystal-wallet/master/getting-started-with-ton-crystal-wallet/wton-how-to-issue-wton-and-transfer-it-to-ethereum) them on [Wrappedever.io](https://wrappedever.io)â€‹
